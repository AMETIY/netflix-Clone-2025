## 🏁 Getting Started
This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AMETIY/Netflix-Clone-2025.git
   cd Netflix-Clone
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm run dev`
Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.  
The page auto-reloads on code changes, and you’ll see lint errors in the console. 🖌️

#### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.  
It bundles React in production mode, optimizes performance, and minifies files with hashed names.  
Your app is ready to deploy!
